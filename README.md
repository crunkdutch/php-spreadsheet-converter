# php-spreadsheet-converter

the ask came in 2 parts. 6 months apart......
1) create a script that would take an xls as input and run through some business logic to create a new xls with additional rows and columns.
2) create another script that would take the output script from step 1), run through more business logic to create an xls with more rows and columns, based on what was done in step 1)
