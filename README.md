# php-spreadsheet-converter

## TLDR; 
- create a script that would take an xls as input and run through some business logic to create a new xls with additional rows and columns.
- create another script that would take the output script from step 1), run through more business logic to create an xls with more rows and columns, based on what was done in step 1)

## Long Version
the ask came in 2 parts. 18 months apart......sometime around 2018-ish for the first one, and then in 2020, shortly before i was made redundant lolz. I have tried to get an original xls to test with, but I can't get a response from the original requester. you will have to take my word for it that this actually DID accomplish the business goal. 

Originally, some ad-ops person had to spend 2 hours to make the generate the output from the FIRST php script. _Only if there were 0 mistakes_. 

Then, a `final` spreadsheet took approx 2 more hours, so 4 hours to create the `final` xls, and there were multiple files that had to be created weekly. 


This set up of scripts would take the original file as input run it and create a new xls file. the `new` xls file would then be used as the input for the 2nd script, to create the `final` xls. 

Both scripts ran in < 1 min, with the approx max columns in each file (65,536)

example usage 

`php getColumnCountFromCell.php < original.xls | parseSpreadSheetFinal.php`
